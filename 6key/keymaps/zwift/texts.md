Be mindful of the traffic, Coco!
Dance on those pedals like it's 1999, Brevy.
Don't forget to breathe in, breathe out, wax on, wax off!
I perspire to perspire!
Rip snorter! Snort ripper!
We're as fast as a roo of mobs!
Speed is only temporary!
If you're succeeding, you're tiring!
Coco, I'll keep a steady pace for you to follow.
No worries, Coco!
Ride Ons for your weird yakka!
Slide slide slide!
Let's keep a brisk bludger, we're no Brevets...



All

A good time to sweat is ANY time!
As long as you're not lost, you're winning.
A smooth pedal stroke is a smooth pedal stroke!
Be mindful of the traffic, Coco!
Can you keep up with me, Brevey?
Carpe Ride Oreos!
Coffee cup of Ride Ons!
Come along, walkers!
Come join the Bowie Brevet Blobby!
Come ride with me, fiends!
Dance on those pedals like it's 1999, Brevy.
Don't forget to breathe in, breathe out, wax on, wax off!
Every effort counts. Keep snorting!
